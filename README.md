# IdentityServer4-Example

## Description

This project is an example implementation of IdentityServer4 using ASP.NET Core. IdentityServer4 is a framework that adds identity management functionality to your applications, including authentication, authorization, and token management. This project demonstrates how to set up IdentityServer4 with in-memory configurations for clients, identity resources, API scopes, and test users.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd IdentityServer4-Example
```

### Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will start running on `https://localhost:5001`.

## Project Structure

- `startup.cs`: Contains configuration for ASP.NET Core services and middleware setup.
- `Program.cs`: Contains the entry point of the application and hosts the ASP.NET Core application.
- `Config.cs`: Contains in-memory configurations for clients, identity resources, API scopes, and test users.

## Configuration

- **Clients:** Configured client applications that can access the IdentityServer.
- **Identity Resources:** Configured identity resources such as OpenID and Profile.
- **API Scopes:** Configured scopes for APIs.
- **Test Users:** Configured users for testing purposes.

## Usage

- This project can serve as a foundation for implementing authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core applications.
- Developers can extend the project by adding more clients, identity resources, API scopes, and test users as per their requirements.
- It can be integrated into various types of applications like web applications, APIs, mobile apps, etc., to handle identity management tasks securely.
